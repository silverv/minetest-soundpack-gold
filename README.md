The sounds aren't meant to be loud â€” if something is really silent, that's how it should be. If you get the loudness of a sound wrong in the game, it will be really disturbing.


Some sounds in minetest are not made by me and they require some volume adjustments -22 dB amplification for water footsteps and rain. I will add them in later once I'm sure that I'm giving correct attribution.
